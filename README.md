## Introduction

Paperscript or Paper is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. The first rule when it comes to paperscript is that there is one rule, it just needs to compile Javascript. The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime. With this, the goal is to create a enviroment that can run seamlessly with other Javascript libaries.


## Installation

Once you have Node.js installed:

```shell
# Install locally for a project:
npm install --save-dev paperscript
```
